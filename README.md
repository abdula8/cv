## EXPERIENCE

## Projects

**Emulating a network system for a company with more than a branch**
<p>
The network system was for more than a branch over the country and multiple buildings on the same site, The main idea is to connect all buildings and sites together and control who can communicate with whom?

#### The project covered the following topics:
- Used Active Directory Domain Controller for user authentication and group policy.
- **For security:**  I used Sophos firewall with the gateway router and applied policies per user to control who can access what on the I internet like sales have access to social media websites and so on,
- Preventing access from sales team to HR team and vice versa by implementing VLAN technology on Cisco switches,
- Implementing redundancy concept using VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol)
- Availability in the way of how network was built
